Publishing-Amazon-SNS-Messages-Privately
In this project, I will be working on a hospital project to send reports online and develop a platform so the patients can access the reports via mobile and push notifications. You will publish the report to an Amazon SNS keeping it secure and private. Your message will be hosted on an EC2 instance within your Amazon VPC. By publishing the messages privately, you can improve the message delivery and receipt through Amazon SNS.
